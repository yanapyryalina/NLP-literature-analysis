# NLP Literature Analysis

## Introduction
Reading is great. And with so many amazing books out there also come great movies, reviews, and summaries. Reading those reviews and watching those films often only gives us a picture of what the book is actually like, though. With the power of data science and natural language processing, I am able to bring another dimension to how we understand literature.

To analyze the literature of my choice, I performed:
- Data Scraping and Cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Sentiment Analysis
- Topic Modeling
- Text Generation

For this project, I look at the following eight writings:
- The Foundation by Isaac Asimov
- A Clockwork Orange by Anthony Burgess
- Comments to the Society of the Spectacle by Guy Debord 
- A Brief History of Time by Stephen Hawking 
- For Whom the Bell Tolls by Ernest Hemingway
- Carrie by Stephen King 
- The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien
- Slaughterhouse Five by Kurt Vonnegut

I chose these writings both out of personal interest and because of their unique subjects, settings, and writing styles.
