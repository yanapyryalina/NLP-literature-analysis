    "### Reading is great. And with so many amazing books out there also come great movies, reviews, and summaries. Reading those reviews and watching those films often only gives us a picture of what the book is actually like, though. With the power of data science and natural language processing, I am able to bring another dimension to how we understand literature.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project, I am looking at the following eight writings:\n",
    "* **The Foundation by Isaac Asimov** - a book I am currently reading, by my favorite sci-fi writer \n",
    "* **A Clockwork Orange by Anthony Burgess** - the writing behind a famous extravagant horror movie by Stanley Kubrik, a book with a unique writing style and vocabulary\n",
    "* **Comments to the Society of the Spectacle by Guy Debord** - a continuation of a book I was taught in university about the influence of the capitalist media on the society\n",
    "* **A Brief History of Time by Stephen Hawking** - a book that excited millions about the workings of our universe\n",
    "* **For Whom the Bell Tolls by Ernest Hemingway** - a writing with a unique writing style and themes specific to American writers\n",
    "* **Carrie by Stephen King** - one of the most well-known horrors out there\n",
    "* **The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien** - a very long journey by very short people, one that so many people and communities hold dear to their heart\n",
    "* **Slaughterhouse Five by Kurt Vonnegut** - a book highly recommended to me"

When his parents emigrated to the United States, Isaac (three years old at the time) stowed away in their baggage. He has been an American citizen since the age of eight. Brought up in Brooklyn, and educated in its public schools, he eventually found his way to Columbia University and, over the protests of the school administration, managed to annex a series of degrees in chemistry, up to and including a Ph.D. He then infiltrated Boston University and climbed the academic ladder, ignoring all cries of outrage, until he found himself Professor of Biochemistry. Meanwhile, at the age of nine, he found the love of his life (in the inanimate sense) when he discovered his first science-fiction magazine. By the time he was eleven, he began to write stories, and at eighteen, he actually worked up the nerve to submit one. It was rejected. After four long months of tribulation and suffering, he sold his first story and, thereafter, he never looked back. In 1941, when he was twenty-one years old, he wrote the classic short story “Nightfall” and his future was assured. Shortly before that he had begun writing his robot stories, and shortly after that he had begun his Foundation series. What was left except quantity? At the present time, he has published over 260 books, distributed through every major division of the Dewey system of library classification, and shows no signs of slowing up. He remains as youthful, as lively, and as lovable as ever, and grows more handsome with each year. You can be sure that this is so since he has written this little essay himself and his devotion to absolute objectivity is notorious. He is married to Janet Jeppson, psychiatrist and writer, has two children by a previous marriage, and lives in New York City. OceanofPDF.com'\n",

    "del_text_tolkien1 = 'THE HOBBIT OR THERE AND BACK AGAIN J.R.R. TOLKIEN The Hobbit is a tale of high adventure, undertaken by a company of dwarves, in search of dragon-guarded gold. A reluctant partner in this perilous quest is Bilbo Baggins, a comfort- loving, unambitious hobbit, who surprises even himself by his resourcefulness and his skill as a burglar. Encounters with trolls, goblins, dwarves, elves and giant spiders, conversations with the dragon, Smaug the Magnificent, and a rather unwilling presence at the Battle of the Five Armies are some of the adventures that befall Bilbo. But there are lighter moments as well: good fellowship, welcome meals, laughter and song. Bilbo Baggins has taken his place among the ranks of the immortals of children’s fiction. Written for Professor Tolkien’s own children, The Hobbit met with instant acclaim when published. It is a complete and marvellous tale in itself, but it also forms a prelude to The Lord of the Rings. ‘One of the most influential books of our generation’ The Times CONTENTS COVER PAGE TITLE PAGE LIST OF ILLUSTRATIONS NOTE ON THE TEXT AUTHOR’S NOTE CHAPTER I: AN UNEXPECTED PARTY CHAPTER II: ROAST MUTTON CHAPTER III: A SHORT REST CHAPTER IV: OVER HILL AND UNDER HILL CHAPTER V: RIDDLES IN THE DARK CHAPTER VI: OUT OF THE FRYING-PAN INTO THE FIRE CHAPTER VII: QUEER LODGINGS CHAPTER VIII: FLIES AND SPIDERS CHAPTER IX: BARRELS OUT OF BOND CHAPTER X: A WARM WELCOME CHAPTER XI: ON THE DOORSTEP CHAPTER XII: INSIDE INFORMATION CHAPTER XIII: NOT AT HOME CHAPTER XIV: FIRE AND WATER CHAPTER XV: THE GATHERING OF THE CLOUDS CHAPTER XVI: A THIEF IN THE NIGHT CHAPTER XVII: THE CLOUDS BURST CHAPTER XVIII: THE RETURN JOURNEY CHAPTER XIX: THE LAST STAGE WORKS BYJ.R.R.

[NAL Release #21] [15 jan 2001 - OCR errors removed - vl] A fourth-generation German-American now living in easy circumstances on Cape Cod [and smoking too much], who, as an American infantry scout hors de combat, as a prisoner of war, witnessed the fire-bombing of Dresden, Germany, \\'The Florence of the Elbe,\\' a long time ago, and survived to tell the tale.
